🛠️ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the build folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build.
